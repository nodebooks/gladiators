** GAS fantasy edition **

WHAT GAS IS?

GAS fantasy edition is an Areena 5/6 style single and multiplayer
manager game spiced with enhanced turn-based battles with time
limits. Play against computer or other players online, train best
gladiators and relive your most formidable battles in real-time!

Gladiator team consists maximum of 8 gladiators. From those player can choose max 4 gladiators to battle. 
Multiplayer game challenges are made between two players. When challenge is accepted, currently active battle 
team is sent to fight on that instant from both parties.


GAME STATE:

MATCH_SYNC message provides a copy of current game state, a snapshot, 
if you will. 

History data consists of:

1. base state in the beginning of battle, with tick number.
2. individual commands with ticks when executed.

A snapshot of game state will be taken and stored into battledb every X ticks.
This snapshot is used to provide a faster access to current game state if 
connection is lost for player in the middle of battle.


SPELLS:

Spells consume mana. Each spell drains specific amount of mana. Half
of spell mana drain is consumed on preparation, and other half on casting.

Spells require a preparation time, which is expressed in ticks. 
Preparation time may be 0, which means that spell may be cast instantly.


COORDINATE SYSTEM:

Server holds grid-based coordinates  with floating-point
values. Integer part contains tile coordinates. 
Decimal part expresses object transition from one tile to another.
Coordinates are converted into pixels by client and therere can be
visualized in different manner by different client implementations.

Example: pos : [1.05, 3.7]

1.05 = tile x-coordinate 1, with 5% moved over to x-coordinate 2.
3.7 = tile y-coordinate 3, with 70% moved over to y-coordinate 4.

Client may choose how transition between tiles is visualized.



SERVER:
 - port 8080 used for websocket communication
 - maple.js
 - couchDB

SERVER installation (Ubuntu Linux 12.04):

** Execute the following commands from the command line
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install pathfinding
sudo npm install websocket

** start gas server by entering its root folder and type
node server/server.js

CLIENT:

- Game object must contain
       Body entity (ie. background animation)
       Head equipment entity (optional)
       Torso entity (optional)
       Belt entity (optional)
       Hands entity (optional)
       Legs entity (optional)
       Feet entity (toes)
       Weapon entity (optional)

- Graphics layers (z-indices)

  Name       Z-index    Desc
  -----------------------------
  Ground     0          Used for bottom layer in tile maps.
  Overlay    1          Used for additional overlay in tile maps
  Behind     2          For some special graphics behind game object (quiver, mostly)
  Body       3          Basic body animation (human + skeleton)
  Equipment  4          Additional armor or wear over the body layer.
  Weapon     5          All weapons stored with this
  Collision  6          Not rendered, shall contain only transparent tiles that help in tile
                        mouse selection.
  Mouse      7          For transparent collision layer over all other sprites in game object.

  Front      8          Used for front layer elements in tile maps (appears over game objects)



KNOWN ISSUES:

    If Crafty is initialized and some component is hidden after that from page,
    Crafty's mouse related coordinates get busted unless you do window resize.
    I believe that this is browser-related and _needs_ to be taken into account
    when designing a page.

    Crafty entities must have .collision(polygon) defined for all entities that wish to use
    SAT collision algorithm. Otherwise sprite MBR is used for _both_.
