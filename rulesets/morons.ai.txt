Morons AI:

AI has four states, making it pretty stupid.

1. IDLE - Do nothing.
2. SEEK_ENEMY - Seeks closest enemy.
3. MOVE_INTO_RANGE - Moves next to specified target.
4. ATTACK - Attacks target until it is dead.
5. DEAD - Well, the final solution.

IDLE state is changed to SEEK_ENEMY when battle starts.
SEEK_ENEMY is changed back to IDLE when no enemies are left.
SEEK_ENEMY is changed to MOVE_INTO_RANGE when enemy has been found.
MOVE_INTO_RANGE is changed to SEEK_ENEMY if enemy is dead / missing.
MOVE_INTO_RANGE is changed to ATTACK when enemy is right next to 
AI in north, south, east or west tiles. Diagonal tiles are not checked.
ATTACK is changed to SEEK_ENEMY if enemy is dead / missing.
Any state is changed to DEAD when health drops into zero.
